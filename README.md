Done as a Course Project . Particle methods of Flow Simulation by Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran.

## Required Theory Terms
- Know how to apply Panel method for a certain geometry ( Constant panel and Linear panel Method)
- Know how to advect particles in a given velocity field with Rk2 implementation
- Know how to diffuse particles in the flow regime using Monte Carlo Scheme ( Random Walk Method)
- Vortex Reflection, Vortex Annihilation and No-Slip vortex generation for accurate simulations.

### Prerequisites(modules)- 
matplotlib
numpy 
scipy

### Simulation Results

Clockwise circulations = Red
Counter Clockwise Circulations = Blue
Simulation Time = 10sec
time_step = 0.2sec
Free stream velocity = 4m/s
